<div id='first' class='first'>
    <p class='first'> Software, libraries, and Methods can be written in Java, C# using Visual Studio, or C++ using QT Creator or SQL Script for databases. We create products for both windows and linux based operating systems. Our server is linux Mint based with a Cinnamon
        desktop environment. For linux based software, we prefer to use QT Creator. Windows based software is created with Visual Studio. Qt based software is written in C++ and Visual Studio based software is written in C-sharp. The common Database software
        we use is MySQL from Oracle. MySQL can be linux or Windows based. The client will recieve an entry / result chart showing user entries and resultant outputs for sign-off. </br>
        </br> A sheet displaying locations and assemblies that cannot be used will be filled out by the client, if there are other routines in use with the requested program. System minimum availabities will be signed-off on as well.

    <div class='last'>Turn-around time is based on complexity. Delievery doesn't end the software job. Client evailuation and testing is monitored with responces. Other languages (assembly, C ) can be used for method creation or command line routines which are preferred
        if new subassemblies are in use.
